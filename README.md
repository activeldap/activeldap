## Description

'ActiveLdap' is a ruby library which provides a clean
objected oriented interface to LDAP library.  It was
inspired by ActiveRecord. This is not nearly as clean or as
flexible as ActiveRecord, but it is still trivial to define
new objects and manipulate them with minimal difficulty.

For example and usage - read the
[document](https://activeldap.github.io/).

## Prerequisites

### Ruby interpreter

  * [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
  * [JRuby](https://www.jruby.org/)

See the above links for installation.

### LDAP client

JRuby doesn't need to install new library because JRuby has builtin
LDAP support. Ruby users need one of them:

* [Ruby/LDAP](https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby-ldap)
* [Net::LDAP](https://rubygems.org/gems/net-ldap)

See the above links for installation.

### Active Model

A toolkit for building modeling frameworks like Active Record and
Active Resource.

## Rails

See [Rails](file.rails.html)
([doc/text/rails.textile](doc/text/rails.md) in the repository and on
GitHub) page for Rails integration.
