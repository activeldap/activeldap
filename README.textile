h2. Description

'ActiveLdap' is a ruby library which provides a clean
objected oriented interface to LDAP library.  It was
inspired by ActiveRecord. This is not nearly as clean or as
flexible as ActiveRecord, but it is still trivial to define
new objects and manipulate them with minimal difficulty.

For example and usage - read the
"document":http://activeldap.github.io/.

h2. Prerequisites

- Ruby intepreter :=
One of them:
* "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org (1.9.3 or 2.0.x)
* "JRuby":http://www.jruby.org/

See the above links for installation.
=:
- LDAP client :=
JRuby doesn't need to install new library because JRuby
has builtin LDAP support. Ruby users need one of them:

* "Ruby/LDAP":http://ruby-ldap.sourceforge.net/
* "Net::LDAP":http://rubyldap.com/

See the above links for installation.
=:
- ActiveModel :=
A toolkit for building modeling frameworks like Active
Record and Active Resource.

h2. Notes

* Only GSSAPI SASL support exists due to Ruby/LDAP limitations
