h2. Description

'ActiveLdap' is a ruby library which provides a clean
objected oriented interface to LDAP library.  It was
inspired by ActivRecord. This is not nearly as clean or as
flexible as ActiveRecord, but it is still trivial to define
new objects and manipulate them with minimal difficulty.

For example and usage - read the
"document":http://ruby-activeldap.rubyforge.org/.

h2. Prerequisites

- Ruby intepreter :=
One of them:

* "JRuby":http://www.jruby.org/

=:
- LDAP client :=
JRuby doesn't need to install new library because JRuby
has builtin LDAP support. Ruby users need one of them:

Record and Active Resource.
