0.7.4:
  * Bugfix: do not base LDAP::PrettyError on RuntimeError due to rescue evaluation.

  * Rollup exception code into smaller space reusing similar code.

0.7.3:
  * Made has_many and belongs_to use :return_objects value
  * Force generation of LDAP constants on import - currently broken

0.7.2:

  * Fix attributes being deleted when changing between objectclasses with shared attributes
  * Added schema attribute case insensitivity
  * Added case insensitivity to the attribute methods.
  * Added LDAP scope override support to ldap_mapping via :scope argument. (ldap_mapping :scope => LDAP::LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, ...)
  * Fixed the bug where Klass.find() return nil (default arg for find/find_all now '*')
  * Added :return_objects to Base.connect()/configuration.rb -- When true, sets the default behavior in Base.find/find_all to return objects instead of just the dnattr string.
  * Hid away several exposed private class methods (do_bind, etc)
  * Undefined dnattr for a class now raises a ConfigurationError
  * Centralized all connection management code where possible
  * Added Base.can_reconnect? which returns true if never connected or below the :retries limit

  * Fixed object instantiation in Base#initialize when using full DNs
  * Added :parent_class option to ldap_mapping which allows for object.parent() to return an instantiated object using the parent DN. (ldap_mapping :parent_class => String, ...)

  * attribute_method=: '' and nil converted to ldap-pleasing [] values
  * Added checks in write and search for connection down (to reconnect)
  * Fixed broken idea of LDAP::err2string exceptions. Instead took errcodes from ldap.c in Ruby/LDAP.

0.7.0:
  * ConnectionError thrown from #initialize when there is no connection and retry limit was exceeded
  * ConnectionError thrown when retries exceeded when no connection was created
  * Separated connection types: SSL, TLS, and plain using :method
  * Localized reconnect logic into Base.reconnect(force=false)
  * Fixed password_block evaluation bug in do_bind() which broke SIMPLE re-binds and broke reconnect
  * Add support for config[:sasl_quiet] in Base.connect
  * (Delayed a case sensitivity patch for object classes and attributes due to weird errors)
  * Add :retry_wait to Base.connect to determine the timeout before retrying a connection
  * Fixed ActiveLDAP::Base.create_object() - classes were enclosed in quotes
  * Added :ldap_scope Base.connect() argument to allow risk-seeking users to change the LDAP scope to something other than ONELEVEL.
  * Cleaned up Configuration.rb to supply all default values for ActiveLDAP::Base.connect() and to use a constant instead of overriding class variables for no good reason.
  * Added scrubbing for :base argument into Base.connect() to make sure a ' doesn't get evaluated.
  * Refactored Base.connect(). It is now much cleaner and easier to follow.
  * Moved schema retrieval to after bind in case a server requires privileges to access it.
  * Reworked the bind process to be a little prettier. A lot of work to do here still.
  * Added LDAP::err2exception(errno) which is the groundwork of a coming overhaul in user friendly error handling.
  * Added support for Base::connect(.., :password => String, ...) to avoid stupid Proc.new {'foo'} crap
  * Add :store_password option. When this is set, :password is not cleared and :password_block is not re-evaluated on each rebind.

  * Fix bug reported by Maik Schmidt regarding object creation
  * Added error checking to disallow DN attribute value changes

  * Import() and initialize() no longer call attribute_method=()
  * Added error condition if connection fails inside initialize()
  * Changes examples and tests to use "dc=localdomain"
  * has_many() entries no longer return nil when empty

0.5.9: 
  * Change default base to dc=localdomain (as per Debian default).
  * schema2.rb:attr() now returns [] instead of '' when empty.
  * Lookup of new objects does not put dnattr()=value into the Base on lookup.
  * Scope is now use ONELEVEL instead of SUBTREE as it broke object boundaries.
  * Fixed @max_retries misuse.
  * Added do_connect retries.
  * Fixed find and find_all for the case - find_all('*').
  * Fixed broken creation of objects from anonymous classes.
  * Fixed broken use of ldap_mapping with anonymous classes.

0.5.8: Bugfix galore
  * Allow nil "prefix"
  * Fixed the dup bug with Anonymous patch.
  * (maybe) Fixed stale connection problems by attempting reconn/bind.
  * Hiding redefine warnings (for now)

0.5.7:
  * Fixed the @data.default = [] bug that daniel@nightrunner.com pointed out
    (and partially patched).

0.5.6:
  * Added support for foreign_key => 'dn' in has_many.

0.5.5:
  * Remove @@logger.debug entries during build
  * Building -debug and regular gems and tarballs

0.5.4:
  * Added Base#import to streamline the Base.find and Base.find_all methods
    - Speeds up find and find_all by not accessing LDAP multiple times
      for data we already have.
  * Added tests/benchmark which is a slightly modified version of excellent
    benchmarking code contributed by 
    Ollivier Robert <roberto -_-AT-_- keltia.freenix.fr>.

0.5.3:
  * Changed attribute_method to send in associations
    - fixes belongs_to (with local_kay) and inheritance around that

0.5.2:
  * Make sure values are .dup'd when they come from LDAP

0.5.1:
  * Changed Schema2#class_attributes to return {:must => [], :may => []}
  * Fixed Base#must and Base#may to return with full SUPerclass requirements

0.5.0:
  * API CHANGE (as with all 0.x.0 changes) (towards ActiveRecord duck typing)
    - Base#ldapattribute now always returns an array
    - Base#ldapattribute(true) now returns a dup of an array, string, etc 
      when appropriate (old default) - This is just for convenience
    - Base#ldapattribute returns the stored value, not just a .dup
    - Associations methods return objects by default instead of just names.
      Group.new('foo').members(false) will return names only.
    - Base.connect returns true as one might expect
  * Value validation and changing (binary, etc) occur prior to write, and
    not immediately on attribute_method=(value).
  * Attribute method validity is now determined /on-the-fly/.
  * Default log level set to OFF speeds up 'speedtest' by 3 seconds! 
    (counters last point which added some slowness :)
  * Added Schema2#class_attributes which caches and fully supertype expands
    attribute lists.
  * Integrated Schema2#class_attributes with apply_objectclass which automagically
    does SUP traversal and automagically updates available methods on calls to
    #attributes, #method_missing, #validate, and #write
  * Added 'attributes' to 'methods' allowing for irb autocompletion and other
    normal rubyisms
  * Moved almost all validation to Base#validate to avoid unexpected exceptions
    being raised in seemingly unrelated method calls. This means that invalid 
    objectClasses may be specified. This will only be caught on #write or 
    a pre-emptive #validate. This goes for all attribute errors though.
    This also makes it possible to "break" objects by removing the 'top'
    objectclass and therefore the #objectClass method...

0.4.4:
  * Fixed binary subtype forcing:
    - was setting data as subtype ;binary even when not required
  * Added first set of unit tests.
    - These will be cleaned up in later releases as more tests are added.
  * Fixed subtype clobber non-subtype (unittest!)
    - cn and cn;lang-blah: the last loaded won
  * Fixed multivalued subtypes from being shoved into a string (unittest!)
    - an error with attribute_input_value

0.4.3:
  * Fixed write (add) bugs introduced with last change
    - only bug fixes until unittests are in place

0.4.2:
  * Added ruby-activeldap.gemspec
  * Integrated building a gem of 'ruby-activeldap' into Makefile.package
  * Added attr parsing cache to speed up repetitive calls: approx 13x speedup
    = 100 usermod-binary-add calls
      - Without attr parsing cache:
        real    13m53.129s
        user    13m11.350s
        sys     0m7.030s
      - With attr parsing cache:
        real    1m0.416s
        user    0m28.390s
        sys     0m2.380s

0.4.1:
  * Schema2 was not correctly parsing objectClass entries.
    - This is fixed for now but must be revisited.

0.4.0:
  * Added #<attribute>(arrays) argument which when true
    always returns arrays. e.g.
       irb> user.cn(true)
       => ['My Common Name']
    This makes things easier for larger programming tasks.
  * Added subtype support:
    - Uses Hash objects to specify the subtype
      e.g. user.userCertificate = {'binary' => File.read('mycert.der')}
    - Added recursive type enforcement along with the subtype handling
    - This required overhauling the #write method. 
      - Please report any problems ASAP! :^)
  * Added automagic binary support
    - subtype wrapping done automatically
    - relies on X-NOT-HUMAN-READABLE flag
  * Added LDAP::Schema2 which is an extension of Ruby/LDAP::Schema
    - made Schema#attr generic for easy type dereferencing
  * Updated rdoc in activeldap.rb
  * Updated examples (poorly) to reflect new functionality
  * Added several private helper functions

0.3.6:
  * Fixed dn attribute value extraction on find and find_all
    - these may have grabbed the wrong value if a DN attr has
      multiple values.
  * Fixed Base.search to return all values as arrays and update
    multivalued ones correctly
  * Lowered the amount of default logging to FATAL only

0.3.5:
  * Moved to rubyforge.org!

0.3.4:
  * Changed license to Ruby's

0.3.3:
  * Changed Base.search to return an array instead of a hash of hashes
  * Change Base.search to take in a hash as its arguments

  * Bug fix - fixed support for module'd extension classes (again!)

0.3.1:
  * Updated the documentation
  * Fixed ignoring of attrs argument in Base.search
  * Fixed mistake in groupls (using dnattr directly)
  * Fixed a mistake with overzealous dup'ing

0.3.0:
  * MORE API CHANGES (configuration.rb, etc)
  * Major overhaul to the internals!
    - removed @@BLAH[@klass] in lieu of defining
      class methods which contain the required values. This
      allows for clean inheritance of Base subclasses! Whew!
    - Added @@config to store the options currently in use
      after a Base.connect
    - Now cache passwords for doing reconnects
    - dnattr now accessible to the outside as a class method only
  * Added Base.search to wrap normal LDAP search for convenience.
    - This returns a hash of hashes with the results indexed first by
      full dn, then by attribute.

0.2.0:
  * API CHANGES:
    - Extension classes must be defined using map_to_ldap instead of setting
      random values in initialize
    - Base#find is now Base.find_all and is a class method
    - Base.find returns the first match a la Array#find
    - force_reload is gone in belongs_to and has_many created methods
    - hiding Base.new, Base.find, and Base.find_all from direct access
  * added uniq to setting objectClass to avoid stupid errors
  * fixed new object creation bug where attributes were added before the
    objectclass resulting in a violation (Base#write)
  * fixed attribute dereferencing in Base#write
  * fixed bug with .dup on Fixnums
  * methods created by has_many/belongs_to  and find and find_all now take an
    optional argument dnattr_only which will return the value of dnattr for
    each result instead of a full object.
  * Base.connection=(conn) added for multiplexing connections
  * Added a manual to activeldap.rb which covers most usage of Ruby/ActiveLDAP
  * Base.connect(:try_sasl => true) should now work with GSSAPI if you are
    using OpenLDAP >= 2.1.29

0.1.8:
  * .dup all returned attribute values to avoid weirdness
  * .dup all assigned values to avoid weirdness
  * Changed default configuration.rb to use example.com

0.1.7:
  * Added support for non-unique DN attributes
  * Added authoritative DN retrieval with 'object.dn'

0.1.6:
  * Added Base.close method for clearing the existing connection (despite Ruby/LDAP's lack of .close)

0.1.5:
  * Fixed incorrect usage of @klass in .find (should .find be a class method?)

0.1.4:
  * Change WARN to INFO in associations.rb for has_many

0.1.3:
  * Fixed class name mangling
  * Added support for classes to take DNs as the initialization value

0.1.2:
  * Patch from Dick Davies: Try SSL before TLS
  * Log4r support

0.0.8:
  * Added user and group scripting examples
    - usermod, userls, useradd, userdel
    - groupmod, groupls

    - SASL (GSSAPI only), simple, anonymous
  * Added allow_anonymous option added (default: false)
