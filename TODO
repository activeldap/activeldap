- Fix DN parsing: RFC2253
- Fix case sensitivity in object classes
- Add result pagination via LDAP::Controls
- serialize & serialized_attributes
- schema mgmt - how does AR handle it?
- columns() -- ?
http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M000865
- provide full documentation for new API.
- handle all exception raised from Ruby/LDAP and wrap as
  ActiveLdap exception. I think we need to develop an
  application using ActiveLdap.
- support Ruby/GetText.
- support Net::LDAP as LDAP backend after Net::LDAP
  supports START_TLS. (I made a patch and submitted to the
  bug tracker of Net::LDAP)
- Add locking around Timeout.alarm() to ensure a multithreaded ruby
  app doesn't hit any race conditions
- Add AR matching exceptions:
* ActiveRecordError -- ActiveLdapError as base
* AssociationTypeMismatch
* SerializationTypeMismatch
* ConnectionNotEstablished
* RecordNotFound
* LdapActionInvalid - like StatementInvalid
* MultiparameterAssignmentErrors
* AttributeAssignmentError
* RecordNotSaved
