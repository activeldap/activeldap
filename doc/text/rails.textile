h1. Rails

ActiveLdap supports Rails 3.1.

h2. Install

To install, simply add the following code to your Gemfile:

<pre>
gem 'activeldap'
</pre>

You should also depend on an LDAP adapter such as Net::LDAP
or Ruby/LDAP. The following example uses Ruby/LDAP:

<pre>
gem 'ruby-ldap'
</pre>

Bundler will install the gems automatically when you run
'bundle install'.

You also need to include the ActiveLdap railtie in
config/application.rb, after the other railties:

<pre>
require "active_ldap/railtie"
</pre>

h2. Configuration

You can use a LDAP configuration per environment. They are in
a file named 'ldap.yml' in the config directory of your
rails app. This file has a similar function to the
'database.yml' file that allows you to set your database
connection configurations per environment. Similarly, the
ldap.yml file allows configurations to be set for
development, test, and production environments.

You can generate 'config/ldap.yml' by the follwoing command:

<pre class="command">
% script/rails generate active_ldap:scaffold
</pre>

You need to modify 'config/ldap.yml' generated by
active_ldap:scaffold. For instance, the development entry
would look something like the following:

<pre>
!!!plain
development:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 389
  base: dc=localhost
  bind_dn: cn=admin,dc=localhost
  password: secret
</pre>

When your application starts up,
ActiveLdap::Base.setup_connection will be called with the
parameters specified for your current environment.

h2. Model

You can generate a User model that represents entries under
ou=Users by the following command:

<pre class="command">
% script/rails generate model User --dn-attribute uid --classes person PosixAccount
</pre>

It generates the following app/model/user.rb:

<pre>
class User < ActiveLdap::Base
  ldap_mapping :dn_attribute => "uid",
               :prefix => "ou=Users",
               :classes => ["person", "PosixAccount"]
end
</pre>

You can add relationships by modifying app/model/user.rb:

<pre>
class User < ActiveLdap::Base
  ldap_mapping :dn_attribute => 'uid',
               :prefix => "ou=Users",
               :classes => ['person', 'posixAccount']
  belongs_to :primary_group,
             :class_name => "Group",
             :foreign_key => "gidNumber",
             :primary_key => "gidNumber"
  belongs_to :groups,
             :many => 'memberUid'
end
</pre>

You can also generate a Group model by the following command:

<pre class="command">
% script/rails generate model Group --classes PosixGroup
</pre>

app/model/group.rb:

<pre>
class Group < ActiveLdap::Base
  ldap_mapping :dn_attribute => "cn",
               :prefix => "ou=Groups",
               :classes => ["PosixGroup"]
end
</pre>

You can add relationships by modifying app/model/group.rb:

<pre>
class Group < ActiveLdap::Base
  ldap_mapping :dn_attribute => "cn",
               :prefix => "ou=Groups",
               :classes => ["PosixGroup"]
  has_many :members,
           :class_name => "User",
           :wrap => "memberUid"
  has_many :primary_members,
           :class_name => "Group",
           :foreign_key => "gidNumber",
           :primary_key => "gidNumber"
end
</pre>

You can also generate a Ou model by the following command:

<pre class="command">
% script/rails generate model Ou --prefix '' --classes organizationalUnit
</pre>

<pre>
class Ou < ActiveLdap::Base
  ldap_mapping :dn_attribute => "cn",
               :prefix => "",
               :classes => ["organizationalUnit"]
end
</pre>
